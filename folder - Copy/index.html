                            <p class = "text text-sm">A new study published in the journal Nature Medicine has found a link between obesity and heart disease. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that people who are obese are more likely to develop heart disease, even if they have no other risk factors.</p>

The researchers believe that the link between obesity and heart disease is due to the fact that obesity can lead to inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which are risk factors for heart disease.</p>
